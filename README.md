# PyGuard_Windows
This is the Windows distribution of PyGuard

It's a text editor like notepad, but it can save and load encrypted files, and has a built in key manager and user database. 

It's a standalone portable .exe file written in python, using the cryptography library. 

I signed it myself, so your antivirus is likely to hate it.

This is version 1.0, and you can tell when you're using it. It looks horrible. But over time I hope to build on this. 

Enjoy!
